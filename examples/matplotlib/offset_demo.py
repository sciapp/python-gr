# This example demonstrates mplot3d's offset text display.
# As one rotates the 3D figure, the offsets should remain oriented
# same way as the axis label, and should also be located "away"
# from the center of the plot.
#
# This demo triggers the display of the offset text for the x and
# y axis by adding 1e5 to X and Y. Anything less would not
# automatically trigger it.
